A simple molecular communication simulator that will have more features...

An environment is created in the main class with a set height and width. 

Cells and molecules can be instantiated in the environment. Currently only the created molecule can move around 
the environment in each simulation cycle and system text shows whether the molecule is in the cell, on the cell's border, 
or outside of the cell.

The extracellular concentration is calculated and printed after each simulation cycle.
