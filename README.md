This is a simple molecular communication simulator created in Java for a mentorship project.

An environment is created in the main class with set height and width. 

Cells and molecules can be created in the environment. Currently, molecules can move around 
the environment in each simulation cycle randomly and the output shows each molecule's location.
Geographic location is based on a grid object created at the start of the program.
